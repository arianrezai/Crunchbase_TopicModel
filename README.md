# Introduction 

The aim of this research is to derive insights from the analysis of the descriptions that startups (and innovative companies in general) provide of themselves.

The most important repository of this type of information is Crunchbase: originally built to track only startups, today the website contains information on public and private companies on a global scale.

Specifically, this project will characterize each company by its name, its description and by the the categorization that is already provided in the dataset. This last element is the main source of information that is going to be analyzed.

In fact, the categories in the dataset are sound but overly specific in the eyes of an investor which is exploring the data looking for new investing opportunities. Due to this, it could be that a company similar to the good-performing ones already in his/her portfolio are mistakenly deemed as completely different.

Through a rational regrouping and through the results of the main NLP techniques we are going to identify more broad, but equally representative categories for the companies.

One main limit of the databased used in this project is that the data is not up to date: Crunchbase allows free-of-charge only to download data up to 2013. However, the benefit of this framework is that it allows to test the models that have been generated and to assess their validity on unseen, recent overviews. For this reason, the project will include a last section dedicated to this.
