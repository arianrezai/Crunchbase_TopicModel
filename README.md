## Introduction 

The aim of this research is to derive insights from the analysis of the descriptions that startups (and innovative companies in general) provide of themselves.


Specifically, this project will characterize each company by its name, its description on Crunchbase and by the the categorization that is already provided in its dataset. This last element is the main source of information that is going to be analyzed.

Through a rational regrouping and through the results of the main NLP techniques we are going to identify more broad, but equally representative categories for the companies.
